    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a Computer Science undergrad with an avid interest <br>in Data Sciences and building new technologies. </p>

      <P> An ambivert by nature, I tend to easily adapt to any kind of environment I am put into.<br> I believe in effective communication because if thoughts and knowledge are not <br>conveyed properly; it is pointless to build ideas <br>that can only breathe inside  a mind and not in reality. </p>

         <p> A tech enthusiast and a digital content creator,I am interested in learning algorithms <br> and industry driven skills. I want to be a part of company where I can grow <br>and learn whilst help the company escalate in its endeavors as well. </p>
